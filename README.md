## Course Description, Objectives, and Outcomes

Computational Social Science (CSS) combines the theoretical paradigms of the social sciences with the expanded data and computational methods of computer science. Massive digital traces of human behavior and ubiquitous computation have both extended and altered classical social science inquiry. This course surveys successful social science applications of computational approaches to the representation of complex data, information visualization, and model construction and estimation. We will examine the scientific method in the social sciences in context of both theory development and testing, exploring how computation and digital data enables new answers to classic investigations, the posing of novel questions, and new ethical challenges and opportunities. Students will review fundamental research designs such as observational studies and experiments, statistical summaries, visualization of data, and how computational opportunities can enhance them. The focus of the course is on exploring the wide range of contemporary approaches to computational social science, with problem sets, programming exercises, and written assignments to gain experience with these methods.

* You will be introduced to the major research paradigms in computational social science.
* You will read recent seminal papers in CSS.
* You will begin to practice implementing CSS methods through assignments.
* You will write analytical assessments of papers, methods, and approaches.


## Required Text

* [S2018] Salganik, Matthew J., *Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age*,  Princeton University Press, 2018. [free online version](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/)
    * You should buy a copy of this book BECAUSE there is a free online version. It will also be a valuable reference in your personal library, and will remain relevant for many years.


## Grades

Grades will be based on your performance on nine assignments, each of which is worth 10 points.

* **Homework:** I will give you 9 assignments. Some of these will be writing assignments. Some of these will be computational exercises.
    * You must submit your assignments by committing and pushing them to your fork of this GitHub repository on your personal GitHub account in the appropriate folder (e.g., `https://github.com/[YourGitHubHandle]/Assignments/A1/[filename]`.)
    * Assignments will be given on the day listed in the Daily Course Outline section of this syllabus (see below). In general, assignments will be due before class at 11:30am a week after they are assigned. However, exact due dates and times will be listed on the assignment.

* **Plagiarism on writing assignments:** Josh and Nora held a Wednesday night lab on what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it. Academic honesty is an extremely important principle in academia and at the University of Chicago. See the course Canvas site library reserves for two chapters on plagiarism.
    * Writing assignments must put in quotes and cite any excerpts taken from another work.
    * If the cited work is the particular paper referenced in the Assignment, no works cited or references are necessary at the end of the composition.
    * If the cited work is not the particular paper referenced in the Assignment, you MUST include a works cited or references section at the end of the composition.
    * Any copying of other students' work will result in a zero grade and potential further academic discipline.

### Late Problem Sets

Late problem sets will be penalized 1 points for every hour they are late. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at 11:30am, the following points will be deducted based on the time stamp of the last commit.

| Example PR last commit | points deducted |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 11:31am to 12:30pm     | -1 points       |
| 12:31pm to 1:30pm      | -2 points       |
| 1:31pm to 2:30pm       | -3 points       |
| 2:31pm to 3:30pm       | -4 points       |
| ...                    | ...             |
| 8:31pm and beyond      | -10 points (no credit) |

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are files that end with the `*.ipynb` suffix. These notebooks are opened in a browser environment and are an open source web application that combines instructional text with live executable and modifyable code for many different programming platforms (e.g., Python, R, Julia). Jupyter notebooks are an ideal tool for teaching programming as they provide the code for a user to execute and they also provide the context and explanation for the code. A number of Jupyter notebooks are provided in the OSM Lab boot camp repository [Tutorials](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/tree/master/Tutorials) folder.

These notebooks used to be Python-specific, and were therefore called iPython notebooks (hence the `*.ipynb` suffix). But Jupyter notebooks now support many programming languages, although the name still pays homage to Python with the vestigal "py" in "Jupyter". The notebooks execute code from the kernel of the specific programming language on your local machine.

Jupyter notebooks capability will be automatically installed with your download of the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python. If you did not download the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can download Jupyter notebooks separately by following the instructions on the Jupyter [install page](http://jupyter.org/install).


### Opening a Jupyter notebook

Once Jupyter is installed--whether through Anaconda or through the Jupyter website--you can open a Jupyter notebook by the following steps.

1. Navigate in your terminal to the folder in which the Jupyter notebook files reside. In the case of the Jupyter notebook tutorials in this repository, you would navigate to the `~/BootCamp2018/Tutorials/` directory.
2. Type `jupyter notebook` at the terminal prompt.
3. A Jupyter notebook session will open in your browser, showing the available `*.ipynb` files in that directory.
  *  In some cases, you might receive a prompt in the terminal telling you to paste a url into your browser.
4. Double click on the Jupyter notebook you would like to open.

It is worth noting that you can also simply navigate to the URL of the Jupyter notebook file in the GitHub repository on the web (e.g., [https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonReadIn.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonReadIn.ipynb)). You can read the Jupyter notebook on GitHub.com, but you cannot execute any of the cells. You can only execute the cells in the Jupyter notebook when you follow the steps above and open the file from a Jupyter notebook session in your browser.


### Using an open Jupyter notebook

Once you have opened a Jupyter notebook, you will find the notebook has two main types of cells: Markdown cells and Code cells. Markdown cells have formatted Jupyter notebook markdown text, and serve primarily to present context for the coding cells. A reference for the markdown options in Jupyter notebooks is found in the [Jupyter markdown documentation page](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

You can edit a Markdown cell in a Jupyter notebook by double clicking on the cell and then making your changes. Make sure the cell-type box in the middle of the top menu bar is set to `Markdown`. To implement your changes in the Markdown cell, type `Shift-Enter`.

A Code cell will have a `In [ ]:` immediately to the left of the cell for input. The code in that cell can be executed by typing `Shift-Enter`. For a Code cell, the  cell-type box in the middle of the top menu bar says `Code`.


### Closing a Jupyter notebook

When you are done with a Jupyter notebook, you first save any changes that you want to remain with the notebook. Then you close the browser windows associated with that Jupyter notebook session. You should then close the local server instance that was opened to run the Jupyter notebook in your terminal window. On a Mac or Windows, this is done by going to your terminal window and typing `Cmd-C` or `Ctrl-C` and then selecting `y` for yes and hitting `Enter`.


## Python tutorials

This course is not a programming course in which you receive in-class instruction on using a programming language such as Python or R. However, you will have assignments that requires some basic use of a programming language. For this reason, I am pointing you to the OSM Lab boot camp repository, which contains six basic Python tutorials in the [`Tutorials`](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/tree/master/Tutorials) directory.

1. [PythonReadIn.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonReadIn.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on basic Python I/O, reading data into Python, and saving data to disk.
2. [PythonNumpyPandas.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonNumpyPandas.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on working with data using `NumPy` as well as Python's powerful data library `pandas`.
3. [PythonDescribe.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonDescribe.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on describing, slicing, and manipulating data in Python.
4. [PythonFuncs.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonFuncs.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on working with and writing Python functions.
5. [PythonVisualize.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonVisualize.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on creating visualizations in Python.
6. [PythonRootMin.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2018/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonRootMin.ipynb). This Jupyter notebook provides instruction on implementing univariate and multivariate root finders and unconstrained and constrained minimizers using functions in the [`scipy.optimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) sub-library.

To further one's Python programming skills, a number of other great resources exist.

* The [official Python 3 tutorial site](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* [QuantEcon.net](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) is a site run by [Thomas Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) (NYU Stern) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/) (Australia National University). QuantEcon has a very large number of high-quality economics focused computational tutorials in Python. The first three sections provide a good introduction to Python programming.
* [Python computational labs](http://www.acme.byu.edu/2017-2018-materials/) of the Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis at Brigham Young University.
* [Code Academy's Python learning module](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)

In addition, a number of excellent textbooks and reference manuals are very helpful and may be available in your local library. Or you may just want to have these in your own library. Lutz (2013) is a giant 1,500-page reference manual that has an expansive collection of materials targeted at beginners. Beazley (2009) is a more concise reference but is targeted at readers with some experience using Python. Despite its focus on a particular set of tools in the Python programming language, McKinney (2018) has a great introductory section that can serve as a good starting tutorial. Further, its focus on Python's data analysis capabilities is truly one of the important features of Python. Rounding out the list is Langtangen (2010). This book's focus on scientists and engineers makes it a unique reference for optimization, wrapping C and Fortran and other scientific computing topics using Python.
