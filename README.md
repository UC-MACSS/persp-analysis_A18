## Course Description, Objectives, and Outcomes

Computational Social Science (CSS) combines the theoretical paradigms of the social sciences with the expanded data and computational methods of computer science. Massive digital traces of human behavior and ubiquitous computation have both extended and altered classical social science inquiry. This course surveys successful social science applications of computational approaches to the representation of complex data, information visualization, and model construction and estimation. We will examine the scientific method in the social sciences in context of both theory development and testing, exploring how computation and digital data enables new answers to classic investigations, the posing of novel questions, and new ethical challenges and opportunities. Students will review fundamental research designs such as observational studies and experiments, statistical summaries, visualization of data, and how computational opportunities can enhance them. The focus of the course is on exploring the wide range of contemporary approaches to computational social science, with problem sets, programming exercises, and written assignments to gain experience with these methods.

* You will be introduced to the major research paradigms in computational social science.
* You will read recent seminal papers in CSS.
* You will begin to practice implementing CSS methods through assignments.
* You will write analytical assessments of papers, methods, and approaches.

## Grades

Grades will be based on your performance on nine assignments, each of which is worth 10 points.

* **Homework:** I will give you 9 assignments. Some of these will be writing assignments. Some of these will be computational exercises.
    * You must submit your assignments by committing and pushing them to your fork of this GitHub repository on your personal GitHub account in the appropriate folder (e.g., `https://github.com/[YourGitHubHandle]/Assignments/A1/[filename]`.)
    * Assignments will be given on the day listed in the Daily Course Outline section of this syllabus (see below). In general, assignments will be due before class at 11:30am a week after they are assigned. However, exact due dates and times will be listed on the assignment.
